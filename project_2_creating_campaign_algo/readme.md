# Generating Pervious Possible Phishing Campaign Names

## Objective
Create a basic efficent algorithum that will generate a list of strings containing unique `Quater`, `Fiscal Year`, and `Region`.

## Task Requirements

1. **Requirements**
   - Max date cut off previous is  `2024`
   - The `Output` must have all possible `Region`.
   - Attempt to figure out the time complexity of your solution using `Big O` Or `Big Theta`.

2. **Output**
   - A list including all possibilities.
